# Brief Description
Based on our research, there are 25% young adults in Australian are suffering mental problem, and walking (especially with pets) is proven to be one of the best way to support mental health. However, there are many reasons leading people to not have an actual pet.

Therefore, we came up with the idea to use a lovely virtual pet to encourage people to go for a walk. We planned to have a number of walking modes:

* Focused Mode: lock your phone while you are walking (option to enable music)
* Guided Meditation Mode: put your headphone on and follow the guidance to meditation
* Interactive Mode: your pet will interact with you through mini games like I spy
